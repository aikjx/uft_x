# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing MathJax integration in the Vue 3 application to provide a more robust, performant, and user-friendly mathematical formula rendering system. The current implementation already includes basic rendering, error handling, and retry mechanisms. This enhancement will add formula validation, performance optimization, accessibility improvements, and advanced rendering features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing mathematical formulas, I want formulas to be validated before rendering so that I can see clear error messages for invalid syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a formula contains invalid LaTeX syntax THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message indicating the syntax issue
2. WHEN a formula is validated successfully THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal rendering
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions for common syntax corrections
4. WHEN a formula contains unsupported commands THEN the system SHALL list the unsupported commands and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want mathematical formulas to be properly accessible so that I can understand them using screen readers or other assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a formula is rendered THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN a user navigates with a screen reader THEN the system SHALL announce the mathematical content in a readable format
3. WHEN formulas are displayed THEN the system SHALL support high contrast mode and custom color schemes
4. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management for interactive formula elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating formulas, I want performance optimization features so that pages with many formulas load quickly and smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple formulas are present on a page THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for formulas outside the viewport
2. WHEN formulas are rendered THEN the system SHALL cache rendered results to avoid re-rendering identical formulas
3. WHEN a page contains many formulas THEN the system SHALL batch render operations to improve performance
4. WHEN formulas are updated THEN the system SHALL only re-render changed formulas, not all formulas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with formulas, I want interactive features so that I can better understand and work with mathematical content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a formula THEN the system SHALL optionally display a tooltip with the raw LaTeX source
2. WHEN a user clicks on a formula THEN the system SHALL optionally allow copying the LaTeX source to clipboard
3. WHEN formulas contain variables THEN the system SHALL optionally highlight matching variables across the formula
4. WHEN a formula is complex THEN the system SHALL provide zoom functionality for better readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive formula management utilities so that I can easily work with mathematical content programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with formulas THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to convert between different mathematical notation formats
2. WHEN managing formula collections THEN the system SHALL provide methods to batch process multiple formulas
3. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL support importing/exporting formulas in various formats
4. WHEN debugging formula issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and diagnostic information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want formulas to display correctly across all screen sizes so that mathematical content is always readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust formula sizes for optimal readability
2. WHEN formulas are too wide for the screen THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling or line breaking options
3. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL re-render formulas to fit the new layout
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL support touch interactions like pinch-to-zoom for formulas

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want formula editing and preview capabilities so that I can create and modify mathematical content easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a formula THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview of the rendered result
2. WHEN typing LaTeX syntax THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and auto-completion
3. WHEN creating complex formulas THEN the system SHALL offer a visual formula builder interface
4. WHEN saving formulas THEN the system SHALL validate and store both the source and rendered versions
